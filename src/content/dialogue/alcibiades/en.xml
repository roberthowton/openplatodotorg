                        thrown you over, <lb n="103a3" />and whereas they have all pestered you with
                        their conversation I have not <lb n="103a4" />spoken one word to you for so
                        many years. The cause of this has been nothing <lb n="103a5" /> human, but a
                        certain spiritual opposition, of whose power you shall be<!-- <note

                        informed at some later time. However, it now opposes me no longer, <lb

                            n="103b" />so I have accordingly come to you; and I am in good hopes

                        observing <lb n="103b3" />you all this time, and have formed a pretty good
                        notion of your behavior to <lb n="103b4" />your lovers: for although they
                        were many and high-spirited, everyone of them <lb n="103b5" />has found your
                        spirit too strong for him and has run away. <lb n="104a1" />

                            resp="Stephanus" n="104a" /> Let me explain the reason of your spirit <lb
                            n="104a2" />being too much for them. You say you have no need of any man
                        in any matter; <lb n="104a3" />for your resources are so great, beginning
                        with the body and ending with the <lb n="104a4" />soul, that you lack
                        nothing. You think, in the first place, that you are <lb n="104a5" />foremost
                        in beauty and stature—and you are not mistaken in this, as is plain <lb
                            n="104a6" />for all to see—and in the second place, that you are of the
                        most gallant <lb n="104a7" />family in your city, the greatest city in <placeName
                            key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and <lb n="104b1" /><milestone

                            resp="Stephanus" n="104b" />that there you have, through your father, <lb
                            n="104b2" />very many of the best people as your friends and kinsmen,
                        who would assist <lb n="104b3" />you in case of need, and other connections
                        also, through your mother, who <lb n="104b4" />are not a whit inferior to
                        these, nor fewer. And you reckon upon a stronger <lb n="104b5" />power than
                        all those that I have mentioned, in Pericles, son of Xanthippus, <lb
                            n="104b6" />whom your father left as guardian of you and your brother
                        when he died, and <lb n="104b7" />who is able to do whatever he likes not
                        only in this city but all over <lb n="104b8" /><placeName
                            key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and among many great nations of the
                        barbarians. <lb n="104c1" /><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus"
                            n="104c" />And I will add besides the wealth of your house: but on this, <lb
                            n="104c2" />I observe, you presume least of all. Well, you puff yourself
                        up on all these <lb n="104c3" />advantages, and have overcome your lovers,
                        while they in their inferiority <lb n="104c4" />have yielded to your might,
                        and all this has not escaped you; so I am very <lb n="104c5" />sure that you
                        wonder what on earth I mean by not getting rid of my passion, <lb n="104c7" />and
                        what can be my hope in remaining when the rest have fled. </p>
