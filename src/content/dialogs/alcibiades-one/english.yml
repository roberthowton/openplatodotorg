    a: |
        `	SO. Alcibiades! You're probably wondering why I'm still hanging around when the rest have given up--even though I was the first to fall in love with you--but I haven't even said hello in all these years, unlike the others, who kept pestering you to talk to them. There's no human reason for this: what held me back was a kind of divine opposition. You'll hear more about that later. But now it's stopped opposing me, so I've come to talk to you. `
    b: |
        `And I'm optimistic that it won't oppose me in future. So anyway, I've been observing you all this time and gotten a pretty good idea of how you treat your lovers. There have been a lot of them, with a high opinion of themselves, but every single one has retreated. They're put off by your high-and-mighty attitude. `
[104]:
    a: |
        `I'd like to explain the reasoning behind that attitude. In your opinion you don't need anyone for anything; you've got so much going for you, body and soul, that you don't think you need anybody else. First off, you think of yourself as very tall and fine-looking--and you're clearly right about that. You also belong to the most enterprising family in Athens--the greatest city in Greece--`
    b: |
        `and have a huge number of distinguished friends and relatives on your father's side, to help you out if you need anything, and just as many on your mother's. Most influential of all, you think, is Pericles, who was named by your father as your and your brother's legal guardian. His influence is so great that he can do whatever he wants, not just here in Athens but everywhere in Greece, and in many major non-Greek regions as well. `
    c: |
        `I'll also add that you're wealthy (though I don't think you pride yourself much on that). It's because you feel superior in all these ways that you've defeated your lovers, who gave up because they just weren't in your league--as you're well aware. That's why I'm certain that you're wondering what on earth I can be thinking. Why haven't I given up on my passion for you? What gives me enough hope to stay put when the rest have retreated? `
    d: |
        `	AL. You may not realize this, Socrates, but you just beat me to it.I was meaning to approach you myself to ask exactly these questions. What on earth do you want? And what gives you enough hope to keep on bothering me, going to such trouble to show up wherever I happen to be? I'm genuinely wondering what your deal is, and I'd love to hear you explain. `
        `	SO. If you're really eager to know what I'm thinking, as you claim, will you listen eagerly as well? Can I be sure that I'm talking to someone who'll stick around to hear me? `
        `	AL. Absolutely! Go ahead! `
    e: |
        `	SO. Careful then! Don't be surprised if it's as hard for me to stop talking to you as it was to get started in the first place. `
        `	AL. Go ahead, please! I will listen. `
        `	SO. OK, I guess I'll have to explain myself. It's difficult, as someone in love, to approach a man who doesn't give in to lovers, but I'll have to get up the nerve to tell you what I think. I'd have given up on my passion a long time ago-�or so I've convinced myself--if I saw you living contentedly with the advantages I just mentioned, and thinking you should spend the rest of your life that way. `
[105]:
    a: |
        `But it's my belief that you have other things in mind. Let me explain-�proving that I really have been giving you my attention all this time. Here's what I think. Supposing some god asked you,"Alcibiades, would you rather live with all the advantages you have now, or drop down dead if you can't acquire even greater ones?" I think you'd choose death. What is the hope that's keeping you alive, then? I'll tell you. You think that as soon as you're old enough to address the the Athenian public--in just a few days--`

    b: |
        `you'll show the Athenians that you deserve greater honors than Pericles or anyone else who ever existed; that showing this will make you the most influential man in Athens;and that if you're the greatest here, you'll also be the greatest in the whole of Greece, and not only in Greece, but among all the non-Greeks living on our continent. And if that same god were to inform you that you must limit your influence to Europe, `
    c: |
        `and won't be allowed to go to Asia or get involved in things over there, I don't think you'd be willing to live under such restrictions-�only if you can spread your name and influence among virtually the whole human race. And I think you believe that no one in history has ever been really significant, except Cyrus and Xerxes. I'm not just speculating: I'm certain that this is what you're hoping. Since you know I'm telling the truth, your response might be,"How is this relevant, Socrates?" `
    d: |
        `I'll tell you, my dear son of Cleinias and Deinomache. It's impossible for you to accomplish all these plans without my help. That's how much influence I think I have over you and your doings, which is why, I think, the god wouldn't let me talk to you for so long, so I waited until he would let me. You're hoping to show Athens that you deserve everything it has to offer, `
    e: |
        `and that this will immediately give you total influence; in the same way, I'm hoping to gain maximum influence over you by showing that I deserve everything you have to offer, and that no guardian or relative, or anyone else except me, can give you the influence you crave (god willing, of course). I believe that the reason the god prevented me from talking to you when you were younger, before you were brimming with such hope, was to prevent our conversation from being a waste of time. `
[106]:
    a: |
        `He's unleashed me now because now you may, perhaps, actually listen. `
        `	AL. Socrates, now that you've started talking you appear even weirder to me than you did when you were just silently following me around--and you looked pretty weird even then! But whether you're right or not about what I'm thinking, it looks like you've made up your mind, and I won't get anywhere trying to convince you otherwise, even if I deny it. OK then. Let's say you're absolutely right about what I'm thinking. How is it that I'm going to get all this with your help, and can't get it without you? Can you tell me? `
    b: |
        `	SO. Are you asking if I can make a long speech, like the ones you're used to hearing? That's not my style. But I think I may be able to show you thatI'm right, provided you're willing to do me just one little favor. `
        `	AL. Sure, as long as it's not anything difficult. `
        `	SO. Do you think answering questions is difficult? `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Then please answer me. `
        `	AL. Go ahead and ask! `
        `	SO. Is it OK if I question you on the assumption that I'm right about what you have in mind? `
    c: |
        `	AL. Sure, if you want. That way I'll find out what you have to say. `
        `	SO. All right then. As I said, you're planning to address the Assembly soon, to give them your advice. Suppose I buttonholed you on your way up to the podium and asked, "Alcibiades, what is up for deliberation? What are you going to advise the Athenians about? Is it something you know better than they do?" What would your answer be? `

    d: |
        `	AL. I'd say, of course, that it's something I know better than they do. `
        `	SO. So you're a good advisor about things you actually know. `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And everything you know you either learned from someone else or found out for yourself? `
        `	AL. Sure. How else could I know anything? `
        `	SO. Is there any way you could ever have learned or found out anything without wanting either to learn from someone else or to look into it for yourself? `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. And would you have wanted to learn or look into something you thought you already knew?`
        `	AL. Of course not. `
    e: |
        `	SO. So is there anything you actually know now, which you didn't think you did not know at some point in the past?`
        `	AL. There can't be. `
        `	SO. Well I have a pretty good idea of what you've learned. Tell me if I leave anything out. If I remember rightly, you learned your letters, and to play the lyre and to wrestle. (You didn't want to learn to play the pipe.) Those are the things you know about--unless of course you learned something else without my knowledge. But as far as I'm aware you've never left the house, day or night, to pursue any other studies. `
        `	AL. No, I haven't been to school on any other subject. `
[107]:
    a: |
        `	SO. So when the Athenians are deliberating about letters, i.e. how to write correctly, will you stand up to give them your advice?`
        `	AL. Certainly not, by Zeus!`
        `	SO. Or how to play the lyre?`
        `	AL. No way!`
        `	SO. And they surely aren't in the habit of deliberating about wrestling in the Assembly. `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. On what topic will you advise them then, when they're deliberating? Not construction, presumably. `
        `	AL. Of course not. `
        `	SO. Because a builder will give them better advice about that than you. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. And not prophecy?`
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Because a prophet could advise them on that better than you. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And he could be tall or short, fine or shameful looking, noble or low�born?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And when someone advises the Athenians about public health, they don't care whether he's rich or poor. They just look for someone who's a doctor. `
    c: |
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. In each case, I think, it's someone who knows about the subject at hand who advises them, not someone who's rich. `
        `	AL. That makes sense. `
        `	SO. When would it be correct, then, for you to get up and advise them? On what subject of inquiry?`
        `	AL. When they're discussing their own business. `
        `	SO. Do you mean business related to ship-building, such as what kind of ships they should get built?`
        `	AL. No I don't, Socrates. `
        `	SO. Because you don't know how to build ships. Is that why, or is there some other reason?`
        `	AL. That's the reason. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Then what kind of business are you talking about?`
        `	AL. When they're deliberating about war or peace, Socrates, or any other aspect of the city's business. `
        `	SO. Do you mean deliberating about who to go to war or make peace with, and how to do it?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Shouldn't they make war or peace with those with whom it is better to do so?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And when it's better? `
    e: |
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And for as long as it's better?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. OK. If the Athenians were deliberating about who to wrestle with, and who to just spar with, and how to do it, would you or a trainer give better advice? `
        `	AL. A trainer, of course. `
        `	SO. Can you tell me what the trainer would focus on when advising them to wrestle with some people but not others, and when and how to do so? For example, they should wrestle with those with whom it is better to do so, right? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And for as long as it's better? `
[108]:
    a: |
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And when it's better? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. What about the lyre? A singer has to play notes and make steps in time to the music, right?`
        `	AL. Yes, he does. `
        `	SO. At the moment when it's better?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And for as long as it's better?`
        `	AL. I agree. `
        `	SO. All right then. Since you used the word "better" for both skills--wrestling and singing to the lyre--`
    b: |
        `what do you call "better" in the case of the lyre? In the case of wrestling, I call it "athletic." What do you call it, along the same lines, for the lyre? `
        `	AL. I don't understand. `
        `	SO. Just try to follow my example. My answer was that "better" means correct in every way. And "correct" presumably means done with the relevant skill, right? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And wasn't the skill in question athletics?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
    c: |
        `	SO. And I used the word "athletic" for what is better in wrestling. `
        `	AL. That's what you said. `
        `	SO. Wasn't it well said?`
        `	AL. I think so, `
        `	SO. Come on, now it's your turn. After all, speaking well is presumably appropriate to you as well. First, tell me what skill includes playing the lyre, singing, and moving correctly to the music. What's this called as a whole? Can you still not say? `
        `	AL. No, I can't. `
        `	SO. Try it this way. What goddesses are the patrons of this skill?`
        `	AL. Do you mean the Muses, Socrates? `
    d: |
        `	SO. Yes. Think, then, what word derived from the Muses do we use for this skill?`
        `	AL. I think you mean "music."`
        `	SO. I do. What does it mean, then, to use this skill "correctly"? Answer the way I did before, when I talked about using the skill of athletics correctly. What do you say in this case? How is it done correctly? `
        `	AL. When it's done musically, I think. `
        `	SO. Well done! All right then, when it comes to doing better in matters of war and peace, what do you mean by "better"? `
    e: |
        `In our previous examples you said that "better" means, in one case,"more musical", and in the other,"more athletic." Try to say, in the same way, what it means in this third case. `
        `	AL. I really can't. `
        `	SO. Surely it would be shameful if, when you were giving advice about food (saying this is better than that, and that it's better to eat it at a certain time and in a certain quantity), and someone asked,"What do you mean by 'better, ' Alcibiades?", if in that case you could answer that what is better is healthier, `
[109]:
    a: |
        `even though you make no pretense to be a doctor, but when it comes to something on which you do claim to be knowledgeable, and on which you're going to stand up to advise the Assembly as an expert--won't you be ashamed if, when asked about this, you have nothing to say, as appears to be the case? Won't that look shameful? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. Think about it then, and do your best to tell me. What's the criterion for deciding what's better when it comes to making peace and waging war on the right people? `
        `	AL. I am thinking, but I can't figure it out. `
        `	SO. Don't you know the kind of injury we accuse each other of when we make war, and what we say to justify going ahead? `
    b: |
        `	AL. I certainly do! We say we've been injured by deception, or violence, or theft. `
        `	SO. Hold on! Injured how by these behaviors? Try to explain the different ways of being injured. `
        `	AL. If by "different ways" you mean "justly or unjustly," Socrates... `
        `	SO. Exactly!`
        `	AL. Well that makes all the difference in the world!`
        `	SO. OK then. Which people will you advise the Athenians to make war on, those behaving justly or unjustly? `
    c: |
        `	AL. That's a bizarre question! Even if someone was planning to make war on people who are behaving justly, he wouldn't admit it. `
        `	SO. Presumably because it's not lawful. `
        `	AL. It certainly isn't!`
        `	SO. And I don't think it's admirable either. So you'll make your speech on these principles?`
        `	AL. I'll have to. `
        `	SO. So here's the answer to the question I was asking just now--what does "better" mean when deciding whether to make war or not, and on whom to do so, or not, and when to do so, or not. It turns out that "better" actually means "more just." Right? `
        `	AL. That's what it looks like. `
    d: |
        `	SO. What, Alcibiades my friend? Don't you realize that this is something you don't know? Or did I not realize that you learned about it after all by studying with a teacher, who taught you to tell the difference between what is more and less just? Well, who is he? Do tell me! That way you can recommend me to him as a student. `
        `	AL. You're joking, Socrates. `
        `	SO. No I'm not, I swear by our friendship--a god whose name I would never take in vain! Just tell me who he is, if you can. `
    e: |
        `	AL. What if I can't? Don't you think I could know some other way about what's just and unjust?`
        `	SO. Yes, if you found it out for yourself. `
        `	AL. Well, don't you believe I could have done that?`
        `	SO. Certainly, if you looked into it. `
        `	AL. So you don't think I could have looked into it?`
        `	SO. I do, if you thought you didn't already know. `
        `	AL. So wasn't there ever a time when I thought that? `
[110]:
    a: |
        `	SO. Fair enough. Can you tell me, then, just when it was that you thought you didn't know about justice and injustice? Come on! Was it last year that you were looking into it, thinking you didn't know? Or did you think then that you did know? Tell me the truth, or our conversation will be a waste of time. `
        `	AL. I thought I did know. `
        `	SO. And the same goes for two years ago, or three, or four?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. But before that you were just a child, right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And I'm certain that back then you did think you knew. `
        `	AL. What do you mean, you're "certain"? `
    b: |
        `	SO. When you were a child I often used to overhear you, at school and other places, playing dice or some other game. You certainly didn't sound like someone who was confused about justice and injustice. On the contrary, I'd hear you loudly and confidently accusing some other child of injustice, calling him a dirty rotten cheat. Isn't this true? `
        `	AL. But Socrates, what else was I going to do when someone treated me unjustly?`
        `	SO. You mean, what should you have done, if you didn't actually know at the time whether you were being treated unjustly or not? `
    c: |
        `	AL. But I did know, by Zeus! It was perfectly clear to me that I was being treated unjustly. `
        `	SO. So even as a child, it looks like you thought you knew about justice and injustice. `
        `	AL. Yes. And I did know, too! `
        `	SO. After finding out when, exactly? Presumably not during the time when you already thought you knew. `
        `	AL. Of course not. `
        `	SO. So when did you believe that you didn't know? If you think about it, you'll find there was no such time. `
        `	AL. By Zeus, Socrates, I've nothing to say to that. `
    d: |
        `	SO. So you don't know about this subject from finding it out for yourself. `
        `	AL. It really doesn't look like it. `
        `	SO. But just now you also said that you knew it without ever having learned it. If you didn't learn it from anyone else, or find it out for yourself, then how do you know it? What's the source of your knowledge?`
        `	AL. Maybe my answer was not correct, when I said I knew by finding it out for myself. `
        `	SO. Then what did happen?`
        `	AL. I learned just like anyone else, I think. `
        `	SO. We've come round in a circle. Who did you learn it from? Do tell me! `
    e: |
        `	AL. People in general. `
        `	SO. If you give the credit to people in general then you're not relying on serious teachers. `
        `	AL. Why not? Aren't they capable of teaching? `
        `	SO. They couldn't even teach someone to play checkers well or badly-�and I think that's less important than justice. What? Don't you agree? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And if they can't teach a less important subject, can they really teach a more important one? `
        `	AL. Yes, I think they can. They can teach a lot of things more important than checkers, anyway. `
        `	SO. Such as? `
[111]:
    a: |
        `	AL. Well, for example, I learned to speak Greek from people in general. I couldn't name any particular teacher, but I credit the same people that you don't consider serious teachers. `
        `	SO. Yes, my noble friend! People in general are good at teaching Greek. You'd be right to turn to them for this kind of instruction. `
        `	AL. Why's that?`
        `	SO. Because on that subject they have something every good teacher needs. `
        `	AL. Which is? `
        `	SO. You know that people who are going to teach anything at all must first know it themselves, right? `
    b: |
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And if they really know something they must agree about it, not disagree?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. If there's something they disagree about, would you say they know it?`
        `	AL. Of course not. `
        `	SO. Then how could they teach that subject?`
        `	AL. There's no way they could. `
        `	SO. Well then. Do you think people in general disagree about what a stick or a stone is? `
    c: |
        `If you ask someone, they all agree on the answer, right? And when they want a stick or stone they all reach for the same thing? The same applies to anything of that kind. That's pretty much what I take you to mean by knowing or not knowing Greek. Am I wrong? `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. So on this sort of thing they agree, as we said, both with each other and in their own minds. And the Greek cities, as civic entities, don't get into disputes because they have different opinions about such things? `
        `	AL. No, they don't. `
        `	SO. So it makes sense that for these things the general public would make good teachers. `
    d: |
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And if we wanted to give someone this kind of knowledge, we'd be right to send him to them for instruction?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. What if we wanted to know not just what a human being is, or a horse, but which ones would be good or bad at running? Would people in general be capable of teaching that? `
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
    e: |
        `	SO. And the fact that they disagree completely is sufficient evidence for you that they don't really know about it, and aren't qualified to teach it? `
        `	AL. It is. `
        `	SO. What if we wanted to know not just what human beings are, but which ones are healthy or diseased? Would people in general be capable of teaching us that?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. And if you saw them disagreeing about it, that would be evidence that they were bad teachers?`
        `	AL. Yes, it would. `
        `	SO. Well then, when it comes to just or unjust people or actions, `
[112]:
    a: |
        `do you think people in general agree with either themselves or each other?`
        `	AL. Far from it Socrates, by Zeus! `
        `	SO. In fact, don't you think that these are the things they disagree about most of all? `
        `	AL. Very much so. `
        `	SO. I doubt you've ever seen or heard people disagreeing so fiercely about what is or is not healthy that that they got into fights over it and killed each other. `
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. But when it's a question of what's just or unjust, I know you've heard of this happening `
    b: |
        `--even if you haven't seen it--from many sources, including Homer. You've heard both the Iliad and the Odyssey recited, right?`
        `	AL. Of course I have, Socrates. `
        `	SO. Both poems are about a disagreement over whether something is just or unjust, aren't they?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And this disagreement brought fighting and death to the Greeks and, on the other side, to the Trojans, and also to Penelope's suitors and Odysseus. `
    c: |
        `	AL. That's right. `
        `	SO. And when Athenians and Spartans and Boeotians died at Tanagra, and later at Coroneia--where your own father Cleinias met his end--the fighting and death were caused, I think, by a disagreement about precisely this, i.e. justice and injustice. Am I wrong? `
        `	AL. No, you're right. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Are we to say, then, that those people actually knew what they were disagreeing about, when they disputed it so fiercely that they made each other pay the ultimate price?`
        `	AL. Apparently not. `
        `	SO. Isn't this the kind of teacher you're giving credit to, then? People who do not have knowledge, as you yourself agree?`
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. How likely is it, then, that you really know what's just and unjust, when you vacillate on the subject, and obviously didn't learn about it from anyone or find it out for yourself?`
        `	AL. Not likely, based on what you're saying. `
    e: |
        `	SO. You shouldn't have said that, Alcibiades. Can you see why?`
        `	AL. What's wrong with what I said?`
        `	SO. You said I was making those statements. `
        `	AL. Well, aren't you saying that I don't know about what's just and unjust?`
        `	SO. No, I'm not. `
        `	AL. Oh, you mean I said it?`
        `	SO. Yes. `
        `	AL. How so?`
        `	SO. Let me explain it this way: if I asked you which is more, one or two, you'd say two?`
        `	AL. I would. `
        `	SO. By how much?`
        `	AL. By one. `
        `	SO. So which of us is saying that two is one more than one?`
        `	AL. I am. `
        `	SO. I asked the questions, and you answered, right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. In this case is it me, the questioner, who's obviously making the statement, or you, the answerer? `
[113]:
    a: |
        `	AL. It's me. `
        `	SO. What if I ask you how to spell the name "Socrates," and you tell me?Which of us is making the statement?`
        `	AL. I am. `
        `	SO. OK, now tell me in general terms. If two people use question and answer to converse, who's the one making statements, the questioner or the answerer?`
        `	AL. The answerer, Socrates, I think. `
    b: |
        `	SO. And wasn't I asking the questions all the way through our discussion? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And you were answering them? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So which of us made the statements? `
        `	AL. It looks like I did, Socrates, based on what we agreed. `
        `	SO. On the subject of justice and injustice, then, this is what was stated: Alcibiades, Kleinias' fine-looking son, doesn't know about these things but thinks that he does, and is about to go to the Assembly to advise the Athenians on things he doesn't know anything about. Wasn't that it? `
    c: |
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. So, Alcibiades, it follows that, in Euripides' words, you probably "heard this from yourself, not me." I'm not the person who made these statements, but you are. You can't pin them on me! But that doesn't mean you you were wrong:the project you have in mind is a crazy one, my excellent friend: undertaking to teach something you don't know without taking the trouble to learn it yourself. `
    d: |
        `	AL. But Socrates, I think it's rare for the Athenian, and the rest of the Greeks to deliberate whether something is more or less just. They think that kind of thing is clear, so they set it aside and consider, instead, what will benefit them in practice. Because I don't think what's just is the same as what's beneficial. A lot of people have benefited from committing huge injustices and others, I think, have behaved justly without any benefit to themselves. `
    e: |
        `	SO. So? Let's say justice is completely different from what's beneficial. Surely you don't think you know what's beneficial for human beings, and why? `
        `	AL. Yes I do, Socrates. What's stopping me? Unless you're going to ask me all over again who I learned from or how I found it out for myself. `
        `	SO. That's no way to talk! If you say something incorrect, and if this can actually be proved using the same reasoning as before, you still think you should hear something new and different! You demand another set of proofs, as if the earlier ones were worn-out old clothes and you won't put them on again unless someone brings you fresh and unsoiled evidence. `
[114]:
    a: |
        `I'll overlook your hostility to the argument, but I'm going to ask you, all the same, how you learned what's beneficial, and who your teacher was. In other words, I'm asking you all the same things as before, bundled into a single question. Then again, the outcome will clear be the same. You won't be able to show that you know what's beneficial either because you learned it from someone else or because you found it out for yourself.Since you're too pampered to enjoy the taste of the same old argument, I'll set aside the question of whether you know or don't know what benefits the Athenians. `
    b: |
        `Instead, why don't you show me whether what's just is the same as what's beneficial, or different? If you want, you can do it by questioning me the way I did you, or just talk through it on your own. `
        `	AL. I don't know if I'm capable of going through it in front of you. `
        `	SO. Please, my friend, just think of me as the Athenian public in the Assembly. When you're there you'll have to convince each individual, right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    c: |
        `	SO. And if someone can convince people one by one, can't he also convince them collectively, provided he knows what he's talking about? A schoolteacher, for example, can presumably convince either an individual or a large group on the subject of letters? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. With numbers, too, won't the same person be able to convince one person or a large group?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And that person will be someone who knows the subject, i.e. an expert in arithmetic?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. Doesn't this apply to you as well? If you're able to convince a large group, won't you also be able to convince just one person on the same subject?`
        `	AL. I guess so. `
        `	SO. And that subject will clearly be something you know about. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Then the only difference between an orator addressing theAssembly and someone having our kind of conversation is that the first convinces people collectively, while the second does so one by one? `
        `	AL. Probably. `
        `	SO. OK then. Since it looks like anyone who can convince a large group can also convince an individual, why don't you practice on me now? Try to demonstrate that what's just is not always beneficial. `
        `	AL. You're a bully, Socrates! `
        `	SO. Maybe! But my bullying is going to convince you of the opposite of what you refused to convince me of. `
        `	AL. Go ahead and talk, then. `
        `	SO. Just keep on answering my questions. `
    e: |
        `	AL. No! You do the talking!`
        `	SO. What? Don't you want to be well and truly convinced? `
        `	AL. Of course I do!`
        `	SO. And if you state, yourself, that something is the case, won't that mean you have been well and truly convinced? `
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. Keep on answering then. And if you don't hear from your own lips that what's just is also beneficial, then don't take it on faith from anyone else. `
        `	AL. I won't. In that case I've got to answer. But I don't suppose it'll dome any harm. `
[115]:
    a: |
        `	SO. You have prophetic powers! Now, tell me, are you saying that some just actions are beneficial and others not?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Well then, are some of them admirable, and others not?`
        `	AL. What do you mean?`
        `	SO. I'm asking if you ever thought anyone did something that was shameful but also just. `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. So everything that's just is also admirable?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. What about admirable things, then? Are they all good, or are some of them good, but not others?`
        `	AL. In my opinion, Socrates, some admirable things are bad. `
        `	SO. And some shameful things are good?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. Is this the kind of thing you mean? Many people are wounded or killed in battle while going to the aid of a comrade or relative, while others, who don't bring aid when they should, get away unharmed. `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. And you'd call this kind of assistance admirable, in that they tried to help those they should, which is courage. Am I right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. But you'd also call it bad, right, in that they were wounded or killed?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    c: |
        `	SO. Aren't death and courage different things?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So aiding one's friends is both admirable and bad, but not in the same respect?`
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. Next, consider whether this kind of assistance is also good, at least in so far as it's admirable, as in the present example. After all, you agreed that it's admirable in that it's courageous. Look at courage itself, then: is it good or bad? Look at it this way: which would you rather have, good things or bad? `
        `	AL. Good things. `
    d: |
        `	SO. And the greatest goods most of all?`
        `	AL. Yes, those most of all. `
        `	SO. And you'd be least willing to have this kind of thing taken away from you?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. What about courage, then? How much would you accept in exchange for having that taken away?`
        `	AL. If I were a coward I wouldn't even want to go on living!`
        `	SO. So you think cowardice is the ultimate evil. `
        `	AL. I do. `
        `	SO. As bad as death, apparently. `
        `	AL. I agree. `
        `	SO. Aren't life and courage the polar opposites of death and cowardice?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    e: |
        `	SO. And you'd want to have the former most of all, and the latter least?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Because you think the former are best and the latter worst?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So you believe courage is one of the best things, and death one of the worst?`
        `	AL. I do. `
        `	SO. In so far as aiding your friends in battle is admirable, then, that's because it involves something good, i.e. courage, which is why you called it admirable? `
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. But you also called it bad, because it involves something bad, i.e. death? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Then this is the right way to talk about each outcome: if you call it bad, in so far as it produces something bad, then you should also call it good, in so far as it produces something good. `
[116]:
    a: |
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. And in so far as it's good, it's admirable, but in so far as it's bad, it's shameful?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So when you say that aiding friends in battle is admirable but bad, that's no different from calling it good but bad. `
        `	AL. I think you're right, Socrates. `
        `	SO. So nothing admirable, to the extent that it is admirable, is bad, and nothing shameful, to the extent that it's shameful, is good. `
    b: |
        `	AL. Apparently not. `
        `	SO. Here's another way of looking at it. A person who's doing admirably is also doing well, right? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And those who do well thrive? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And they thrive because they've got good things? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. And they acquire good things by doing well and admirably? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So doing well is good? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Isn't good behavior admirable? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    c: |
        `	SO. So once again the same thing has turned out to be both good and admirable?`
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. So if we find something admirable we'll also find it good--based on this argument, at least, `
        `	AL. Yes, we'll have to. `
        `	SO. Well then, are good things beneficial or not?`
        `	AL. They are. `
        `	SO. Do you remember what we agreed when we were talking about justice? `
        `	AL. I think it was that people who are behaving justly must also be behaving admirably. `
        `	SO. And vice versa? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    d: |
        `	SO. And that good things must be beneficial?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So, Alcibiades, what's just is beneficial?`
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. What? Isn't it you who are making this statement, while I ask the questions?`
        `	AL. It looks like I am, apparently. `
        `	SO. Then if someone stands up to advise the Athenians, or even thePeparathians, thinking he understands what's just and unjust, and states that what's just is sometimes bad, wouldn't you simply laugh at him? `
    e: |
        `After all, you're the one stating that the same things are just and beneficial. `
        `	AL. No, by the gods, Socrates! I don't even know myself what I am stating. I feel weirdly disoriented. What I think changes from one moment to the next when you're questioning me. `
        `	SO. Don't you know what's wrong with you, my friend?`
        `	AL. No, I don't. `
        `	SO. If someone asked whether you have two eyes or three, or two hands or four, or anything else like that, do you think you'd answer differently from one moment to the next? Or would your answer always be the same? `
[117]:
    a: |
        `	AL. At this point I'm afraid to say anything, but I think it would be the same. `
        `	SO. And isn't that because you know the answers?`
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. So if you give opposite answers about something, without meaning to, it's clear that you don't know about that subject. `
        `	AL. I guess not. `
        `	SO. You say you vacillate on the subject of what's just or unjust, admirable or shameful, beneficial or not. Isn't it clearly because you don't know about these things that you're vacillating? `
    b: |
        `	AL. Yes, it is. `
        `	SO. Is this the case in general, then: when someone doesn't know something, his soul necessarily vacillates on that subject? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Really? Do you know how to ascend into the sky?`
        `	AL. No I don't, by Zeus. `
        `	SO. Does your opinion on that also vacillate?`
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Do you know the reason, or shall I tell you?`
        `	AL. Tell me. `
        `	SO. It's because, my friend, you don't know it and you also don't think that you do. `
    c: |
        `	AL. Again, what do you mean?`
        `	SO. Let's consider it together. If you don't know something, and realize that you don't know it, do you vacillate on that subject? I assume, for example, that you know you don't know how to cook a meal. `
        `	AL. Certainly not!`
        `	SO. Do your opinions on cooking vacillate, or do you just leave it to someone who knows how to do it? `
        `	AL. I leave it to them. `
    d: |
        `	SO. What if you were traveling by ship? Would you have opinions about whether to steer to port or starboard--opinions that vacillate because you don't really know--or would you keep quiet and leave it to the helmsman?`
        `	AL. I'd leave it to the helmsman. `
        `	SO. So you don't vacillate about things you don't know, as long as you know that you don't know them, right?`
        `	AL. It doesn't look like it. `
        `	SO. Are you aware that mistakes in behavior are also caused by this kind of ignorance, i.e. by thinking we know things when we don't?`
        `	AL. Again, what do you mean?`
        `	SO. If we undertake an action, we do so, presumably, at a time when we think we know what we're doing?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    e: |
        `	SO. And when people don't think they know how to do something, they hand it over to someone else? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Such people don't have knowledge, but still live free of mistakes because they leave these things to others? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Who makes mistakes, then? Presumably not anyone knowledgeable. `
[118]:
    a: |
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. If it's not knowledgeable people, or people without knowledge who know that they don't know, who does that leave, except people who don't know but think that they do? `
        `	AL. No. Those are the ones. `
        `	SO. So this is the ignorance that makes bad things happen, and this lack of knowledge is disgraceful? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. When it's about the most important things, that's when it does the most harm and is most shameful, right?`
        `	AL. Very much so. `
        `	SO. Well, can you tell me anything more important than what's just and admirable and good and beneficial?`
        `	AL. I certainly can't. `
        `	SO. And aren't these the subjects on which you say you vacillate?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. But if you're vacillating, isn't it clear from our argument that you're not only ignorant of the most important things, but also think you know them even though you don't? `
        `	AL. Probably. `
        `	SO. Wow, Alcibiades, you're in a really bad way! I hesitate to spell it out, but since it's just the two of us I have to say something. You're wedded to the ultimate ignorance, my excellent friend--a crime of which you stand accused both by the argument and by your own lips. That's the reason you're rushing into politics without getting a proper education. But you're not the only one in such a state. The same applies to most people conducting this city's business, except for a few--possibly including your guardian, Pericles. `
    c: |
        `	AL. You know, Socrates, people say he didn't become wise of his own accord but by associating with a lot of wise men, including Pythokleides and Anaxagoras. Even now, at his advanced age, he spends time with Damon for the same reason. `
        `	SO. Well, have you ever seen someone wise who was incapable of transmitting his wisdom to someone else? Take the person who taught you your letters. He was wise on that subject and was able to make you that way too, plus anyone else that he wanted to, right? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    d: |
        `	SO. And now that you've learned from him, you'll be able to teach someone else yourself? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And the same goes for the lyre player and athletic trainer? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. Because if a knowledgeable person can show he's passed on his knowledge to someone else, that's good evidence, presumably, that he really is knowledgeable? `
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. Well then, can you tell me who Pericles made wise? Let's start with his sons. `
        `	AL. But Socrates, both his sons turned out to be dummies! `
        `	SO. Then what about your brother, Kleinias? `
        `	AL. Why bring up Kleinias? He's crazy! `
        `	SO. OK, if Kleinias is crazy, and Pericles' sons are dummies, what excuse shall we give him for letting you remain in this state? `
        `	AL. It's on me, I think, for not paying attention. `
[119]:
    a: |
        `	SO. Well then, tell me anyone at all--Athenian or foreigner, free or enslaved--that people say became wiser by spending time with Pericles. After all, I can tell you about Pythodorus, son of Isolochus, and Kallias, son of Kalliades, who spent time with Zeno: they each paid him 100 minae and have become famous for their wisdom. `
        `	AL. I really can't, by Zeus. `
        `	SO. All right. Then what are you planning to do about yourself? Leave yourself in the state you're in now, or work on some self-improvement? `
    b: |
        `	AL. We'll have to plan that together, Socrates. But I do understand what you're saying, and I agree. I don't think the people conducting the city's business, with a few exceptions, have had a proper education. `
        `	SO. Why do you say that? `
        `	AL. If they had been properly educated, then anyone trying to compete with them would have to learn and train before going up against them, like he would for an athletic contest. But since they've entered public life as ordinary citizens, why should I bother with training or learning? I'm certain I'll do much better than them, thanks to my natural ability. `
    c: |
        `	SO. Wow! What a thing to say, my excellent friend! How unworthy of your fine looks and everything else you have going for you! `
        `	AL. Why do you say that, Socrates? What's your point? `
        `	SO. You're infuriating! And so is my passion for you! `
        `	AL. Why's that? `
        `	SO. Because you think those people are your competition. `
        `	AL. Who is, then? `
    d: |
        `	SO. What a great question, for a man who thinks so highly of himself! `
        `	AL. What do you mean? Are they not my competitors? `
        `	SO. If you intended to take the helm of a trireme, on the brink of battle, would you be satisfied with being the best helmsman among your sailors? You'd assume that was necessary, of course, but wouldn't you focus on your real competitors--the enemy--not on your fellow soldiers, the way you're doing now? You'd have to be so far above your own men that they wouldn't even think of competing against you, `
    e: |
        `but would stand at your side--even though you look down on them--to compete together against the enemy. That's if you really do intend to perform some admirable exploit for everyone to see--something worthy of yourself and Athens. `
        `	AL. That certainly is what I intend! `
        `	SO. Is it really worthy of you, then, to be content with surpassing your own men, instead of training to become better than the ordinary soldiers and then focusing on your opponents' leaders? `
[120]:
    a: |
        `	AL. Who are you talking about, Socrates? `
        `	SO. You know that our city is regularly at war with Sparta or the GreatKing of Persia, right?`
        `	AL. Right. `
        `	SO. If you're planning to govern Athens, then, wouldn't it be correct to think of yourself as competing with the kings of Sparta and Persia?`
        `	AL. You're probably right. `
        `	SO. But oh no, my friend! You have to focus on Meidias the quail-fighter and people like that, `
    b: |
        `who take on the city's business even though they're so uncultured that their souls haven't got rid of the cropped hair of slavery--what woman call a servile haircut--and they still can't speak proper Greek. They're here to suck up to the city, not rule it. And these are the people you have to focus on, instead of improving yourself! Really? On the brink of such a serious contest shouldn't you learn everything that can be learned, and train in those skills that require training, preparing yourself in every possible way `
    c: |
        `before entering public life? `
        `	AL. I do think you're right, Socrates. But I also think the Spartan generals and the Persian king are no better than anyone else. `
        `	SO. Take a closer look at your thinking, my excellent friend! `
        `	AL. How do you mean? `
    d: |
        `	SO. First, do you think you would or would not make more of an effort to improve yourself if you were afraid of those others, and thought them intimidating? `
        `	AL. Clearly I would, if that's what I thought of them. `
        `	SO. I assume you don't think that improving yourself would do you any harm?`
        `	AL. Far from it! I think it would do me a lot of good. `
        `	SO. So that's the first flaw in your thinking, and it's a big one. `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. The second is that it's false. Look at it in terms of what appears likely. `
        `	AL. How do you mean? `
    e: |
        `	SO. Are naturally gifted people more likely to be born in noble families or ordinary ones? `
        `	AL. In noble families, clearly. `
        `	SO. Isn't it likely that naturally gifted people, if they're also well brought up, will turn out completely good? `
        `	AL. They would have to, yes. `
        `	SO. Then let's compare our own situation with the kings of Sparta and Persia. First, do you think their families are inferior? Don't we know, in fact, that the Spartan kings are descended from Herakles and the Persian king from Achaemenes, both of whom trace their line back to Perseus, son of Zeus? `
[121]:
    a: |
        `	AL. Yes, Socrates. And my line goes back to Eurysakes, and his to Zeus. `
        `	SO. Yes, noble Alcibiades. And my line goes back to Daidalos, and he goes back to Hephaistos, son of Zeus. But those royal lineages, starting in our generation and going all the way back to Zeus, are made up entirely of kings who are the sons of kings--some of them of Argos or Sparta, others the kings for all eternity of Persia and often of Asia too (as they are at the moment). But you and I are ordinary citizens, and so were our fathers. `
    b: |
        `If you had to make a speech to Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, glorifying your ancestors and Salamis, the home of Eurysakes, or Aegina, the home of Aiakos even earlier, imagine how much laughter you would bring upon yourself!Here's another thing to consider. Those men don't just have a loftier lineage than us, but a superior upbringing too. Or haven't you heard how much the Spartan kings have going for them? Their wives are guarded by the ephors at public expense, so that--as far as possible--no king can be secretly sired by anyone who is not of Heracles' line. `
    c: |
        `The king of Persia is even more powerful, so much so that no one even suspects an heir could be sired by anyone but him. That's why there's nothing guarding the king's wife, except fear. And when the eldest son, the heir to the throne, is born, first there's a festival for all the king's subjects, then every year, forever after, the whole of Asia celebrates his birthday with sacrifices and festivals. `
    d: |
        `But when we are born, Alcibiades, not even the neighbors hear a thing about it--to quote the comic poet.Next, the royal heir is brought up not by a paltry female nurse but by whichever eunuchs are considered the very best in the king's household. They are tasked with seeing to the newborn's care. Among other things, they contrive to make the child grow up to be as fine-looking as possible, by shaping and straightening his limbs. `
    e: |
        `And they're honored highly for this work.When the boys turn seven they're sent to learn horsemanship and start hunting wild animals. When he turns fourteen he's put into the care of people called the royal tutors. These are Persian men of mature age, selected because they're thought to be the very best. There are four of them: the most wise, the most just, the most self-disciplined, and the most courageous. `
[122]:
    a: |
        `The wisest teaches the boy the magic of Zoroaster, son of Oromazos (a form of religious worship); he also teaches him what a king needs to know. The most just teaches him to tell the truth through his entire life. The most self-disciplined teaches him not to be governed by any pleasure whatsoever, so that he gets used to being a free man and a true king--one who, in the first instance, governs his own impulses instead of being enslaved to them. The most courageous trains him to be brave and fearless, in the belief that fear makes someone a slave. `
    b: |
        `Contrast your situation, Alcibiades. The person Pericles put in charge of you, to be your tutor, was Zopyrus the Thracian, whose extreme age made him the least useful slave in the whole household. I could go on to describe the rest of your competitors' upbringing and education, but it would be a big job, and in any case I've said enough to make it clear what comes next. But as for your birth, upbringing, and education, Alciabiades, and that of any other Athenian, virtually no one takes any care over it--unless some man happens to be in love with you.Here's another thing: if you want to focus on the Persians' wealth, their luxury, attire, `
    c: |
        `flowing garments, exotic perfumes, vast retinues, and all the rest of their pampered decadence, you'd be ashamed of yourself if you realized just how far you fall short. On the other hand, if you wanted to focus on the self-discipline and decorum of the Spartans, their fortitude, composure, high opinion of themselves, discipline, courage, endurance, and love of hard work, victory and honor, you'd think yourself no better than a child in all these respects. `
    d: |
        `Let's not leave out your wealth either, in case you pay any attention to that, and think it makes you something special. Perhaps this will make you realize where you stand. If you want to look at the Spartans' wealth, you'll realize that it's far greater than our own. As for all the land they own, in both Sparta and Messene, there's not a single person in Athens who would dispute its abundance and richness, or its wealth of slaves, especially the Helots, or indeed of horses or the other herds pastured in Messene. `
    e: |
        `But even if we set all that aside, there's more gold and silver in Sparta alone than the rest of Greece put together. It's been flowing in through many generations, from all the Greeks and often from non-Greeks as well, `
[123]:
    a: |
        `but it never flows out again. It's just like what the vixen said to the lion in Aesop's fable: the tracks of the money heading into Sparta are clearly visible, but no one can see them coming out. You can be certain, then, that theSpartans are the wealthiest of the Greeks in gold and silver. And their king is the wealthiest of all, because such riches accrue to the kings most often and most abundantly. Added to that, the Spartans pay their kings a considerable sum in tribute. `
    b: |
        `Even if the Spartans have great wealth compared to the rest of Greece, though, it's nothing compared to that of the Persians and their king. I once met a trustworthy man who had traveled inland to the king's court, and he told me that he'd passed a very large, rich piece of land, nearly a day's journey across, which the locals call "the queen's belt." `
    c: |
        `He told me that there's another place called "the queen's veil," and many other fine, rich areas set aside to pay for her adornment, each named for a particular item of that kind. So imagine if someone said to the king's mother, Xerxes' wife,"Deinomache's son intends to pit himself against your son. Her adornments are worth 50 minae at the very most, and he has less than 300 acres of land in Erchia." `
    d: |
        `I think she'd wonder what gives this guy Alcibiades the confidence to compete with Artoxerxes. I think she'd say the only thing that can be giving this man such confidence is wisdom and self-improvement, since the Greeks have nothing else worth mentioning. But if she heard that this person Alcibiades was behaving like this, first, before he's even turned twenty, and second, without any of the proper education; not only that, but, when the man who's in love with him tells him he has to learn, and improve himself, `
    e: |
        `and go into training before trying to compete with the king, he doesn't want to, and says he's OK as he is--if she heard all that, I think she'd be surprised and ask,"Then where on earth does this teenager get his confidence?" And if we replied that it comes from being tall and fine-looking, and having noble birth, wealth, and natural gifts, she'd think we were crazy, Alcibiades, when she considered how much they have of everything like that. `
[124]:
    a: |
        `I think that Lampito, the daughter of Leotychides, wife of Archidamos, and mother of Agis--who were all Spartan kings--would be surprised too, considering all they've got going for them, if you intend to compete with her son when you're in such bad shape. And yet, don't you think it's shameful if our enemies' women understand better than we do ourselves what kind of people we need to be if we're to take them on?No, my carefree friend, put your trust in me and the Delphic inscription, and "know thyself." `
    b: |
        `Know, that is, that these are the people we're competing with, not the ones you were thinking of. And the only way we'll surpass them in any way is by self-improvement and skill. If you fall short in these respects, you'll also fall short of getting famous among both Greeks and non-Greeks--and I think you're more passionate about that than anyone ever was about anything. `
        `	AL. What kind of improvement should I make then, Socrates? Can you explain? Because it looks like what you said is absolutely right. `
    c: |
        `	SO. Yes, I can. But let's consider together how we can both become as good as possible. Because I'm not saying that you need educating and I don't. I'm no better than you, except in one way. `
        `	AL. What's that? `
        `	SO. My guardian is better and wiser than your Pericles. `
        `	AL. Who are you talking about, Socrates? `
        `	SO. A god, Alcibiades, the one who wouldn't let me talk to you until today. He's what makes me confident that your rise to glory will come through no one else but me. `
    d: |
        `	AL. You're kidding, Socrates. `
        `	SO. Maybe. But I'm right when I say we need self-improvement. That applies to everyone, of course, but most especially to the two of us. `
        `	AL. You're not wrong, in my case. `
        `	SO. Or in my own. `
        `	AL. What should we do, then?`
        `	SO. We must not hesitate or weaken, comrade!`
        `	AL. No, Socrates, that wouldn't be appropriate. `
    e: |
        `	SO. No it wouldn't. So we must look at the problem together. Tell me this: we say we want to become as good as possible, right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. With what kind of goodness?`
        `	AL. Clearly the kind that makes men good. `
        `	SO. Men good at what?`
        `	AL. Clearly at getting things done. `
        `	SO. What kind of things? Do you mean horsemanship?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Because for that we'd go to horsemanship experts?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Do you mean sea-faring, then?`
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Because for that we'd go to sea-faring experts?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. What kind of thing, then? Whose activities must we be good at?`
        `	AL. Those of the Athenian elite. `
[125]:
    a: |
        `	SO. By "elite" do you mean wise people, or ignorant ones?`
        `	AL. Wise ones. `
        `	SO. Isn't each person good at whatever he's wise about?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And if he's ignorant about something, he's useless at it? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. A cobbler is wise about making shoes, isn't he?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So he's good at that?`
        `	AL. Yes, he is. `
        `	SO. But he's ignorant about making clothes, right?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. So he's bad at that. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So the same person is both good and bad, at least according to this argument. `
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. Are you saying that good men can also be bad?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Then who do you mean by "good men"?`
        `	AL. I'd say those capable of governing in the city. `
        `	SO. Not, presumably, governing horses?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. But rather, human beings?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. When they're ill?`
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Or sailing?`
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. Or harvesting?`
        `	AL. No. `
    c: |
        `	SO. When they're doing nothing, or something?`
        `	AL. Doing something. `
        `	SO. Doing what? Try and make it clear for me. `
        `	AL. Living together, collaborating, and dealing with each other, as we do when we live in cities. `
        `	SO. So you're saying that they govern people who have dealings with other people? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. You don't mean they govern the time-keepers who deal with oarsmen?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Because it's helmsmen who are good at that?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Then are you saying they govern pipe-players, who head up a chorus and deal with the dancers? `
    d: |
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Because it's chorus-masters who are good at that?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. Then what do you mean when you say they're able to govern people who have dealings with other people? `
        `	AL. I'm talking about people who are involved in civic society and collaborate with each other--those are the people in the city that they govern. `
        `	SO. What's their skill, then? Suppose I asked you again, as I did just now, what skill gives someone the knowledge to govern people involved in sea-faring?`
        `	AL. Helmsmanship. `
    e: |
        `	SO. And what knowledge enables someone to govern people involved in choral song?`
        `	AL. The knowledge you mentioned just now, that of the chorus-master. `
        `	SO. Well then, what do you call the knowledge that enables someone to govern people involved in civic society? `
        `	AL. I'd call it the ability to give sound advice, Socrates. `
        `	SO. Well then, do you think advice given by a helmsman is bad advice?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. In fact, it's sound? `
[126]:
    a: |
        `	AL. I think so, at least if the goal is to keep people safe while they're sailing. `
        `	SO. Well said! OK then, this ability to give sound advice that you mentioned, what's its goal?`
        `	AL. To manage the city better and keep it safe. `
        `	SO. And what needs to be present or absent for it to be managed better and kept safe? For example, if you asked me "What needs to be present or absent for the body to be managed better and kept safe?" I'd reply that health must be present and disease must be absent. Wouldn't you agree? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. And if you asked me next,"What needs to be present for eyes to be better?" I'd reply, along the same lines, that sight needs to be present, and blindness absent. It's the same with ears: they're improved and cared for better if deafness is absent and hearing is present. `
        `	AL. Correct. `
        `	SO. What about a city, then? What needs to be present or absent for it to be improved, and cared for and managed better? `
    c: |
        `	AL. In my opinion, Socrates this happens when friendship is present among its members, and hatred and discord are absent. `
        `	SO. By "friendship" do you mean agreement or disagreement?`
        `	AL. Agreement. `
        `	SO. What skill allows cities to agree about numbers?`
        `	AL. Arithmetic. `
        `	SO. Isn't that also the case for ordinary citizens?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And that's also what allows each of us to agree with himself? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    d: |
        `	SO. What skill allows each of us to agree with himself about whether a cubit is longer or shorter than a hands-width? Isn't it measurement?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And that's also how cities and ordinary citizens reach agreement?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And isn't it the same with weight?`
        `	AL. I'd say so. `
        `	SO. Then this "agreement" you're talking about, what is it? What's it about, and what skill produces it? And is it the same thing in a city and an ordinary citizen, both internally and with regard to others? `
        `	AL. I guess it is. `
    e: |
        `	SO. What is it then? Don't get tired of answering. Do your best to tell me. `
        `	AL. I think I mean the friendship and agreement between an loving father and mother and their son, or two brothers, or a husband and wife. `
        `	SO. Do you think a husband and wife can agree about wool-working-�something she knows about but he doesn't? `
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. And he doesn't need to either: that's a woman's sphere of learning. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
[127]:
    a: |
        `	SO. OK then, could a woman agree with a man about armed combat, even though she's never learned anything about it?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. You'd probably say that's a man's sphere. `
        `	AL. I would. `
        `	SO. So according to your argument, men and women have distinct spheres of learning?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. So there can't be agreement between men and women, at least in these spheres? `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. So there can't be friendship between them either, if friendship really is agreement. `
        `	AL. Apparently not. `
        `	SO. In so far as women operate in their own sphere, then, men can't be friends with them? `
    b: |
        `	AL. It doesn't look like it. `
        `	SO. And the same applies to men who operate in their sphere--women can't be their friends. `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. So when each group operates in its own sphere, cities are not well managed?`
        `	AL. No, Socrates, I think they are. `
        `	SO. What? Even though they lack friendship? Didn't we say that cities are well managed if friendship is present, and not otherwise? `
        `	AL. But Socrates, I think this is exactly what gives rise to mutual friendship: the fact that each group operates in its own sphere. `
    c: |
        `	SO. That's not what you said before. So what are you saying now?Can there be friendship without agreement? Or can there be agreement on things that one group knows about and the other doesn't? `
        `	AL. No. That would be impossible. `
        `	SO. And when each group operates in its own sphere, are they behaving justly or unjustly? `
        `	AL. Justly, of course. `
        `	SO. When citizens in a city are behaving justly, then, doesn't that produce mutual friendship?`
        `	AL. Yes Socrates, I think it has to. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Then what are you saying about friendship and agreement?You said that if we're to be good men, this is a subject on which we must be wise and able to give sound advice. But I can't figure out either what it is or who has it.Based on your argument, the same group of people sometimes obviously has it, and sometimes doesn't. `
        `	AL. By the gods, Socrates, I don't even know myself what I'm saying!I've probably been in a thoroughly shameful state for ages without realizing it. `
        `	SO. Cheer up! If it took you until you were fifty to realize this, it would be difficult for you to improve yourself. `
    e: |
        `As it is, though, you're at exactly the right age to have this realization. `
        `	AL. And now that I've done so, Socrates, what should I do next?`
        `	SO. Just answer my questions, Alcibiades. If you do that, then, god willing--and if we should have any confidence in my prophecy--both you and I will get into a better state. `
        `	AL. That will happen, if all I have to do on my end is keep answering. `
        `	SO. All right then, what is self-improvement? After all, we often think we're improving ourselves without realizing that in fact we're not. `
[128]:
    a: |
        `And when does someone do it? When he improves what belongs to him, is he also improving himself? `
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. OK then, when does someone improve his feet? Is it when he's improving what belongs to his feet?`
        `	AL. I don't understand. `
        `	SO. Would you ever say something "belongs" to a hand? For example, does a finger-ring belong to any part of a person other than the finger?`
        `	AL. Of course not. `
        `	SO. And along the same lines, doesn't a shoe belong to a foot?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And in the same way, clothes and bedding belong to the rest of the body?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    b: |
        `	SO. When we improve our shoes, then, are we improving our feet?`
        `	AL. I don't really understand, Socrates. `
        `	SO. OK then, Alcibiades. Would you say there's a correct way to improve anything, no matter what? `
        `	AL. I would. `
        `	SO. When someone makes something better, isn't that what you'd call correct improvement? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. What skill makes shoes better, then? `
        `	AL. Cobbling. `
        `	SO. So we use cobbling to improve our shoes? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
    c: |
        `	SO. And do we also use cobbling to improve our feet? Or do we use the skill that makes feet better?`
        `	AL. The one that makes feet better. `
        `	SO. And that's the same skill that improves the rest of the body, right?`
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. And that skill is athletics?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So we use athletics to improve our feet, but cobbling to improve what belongs to our feet?`
        `	AL. Sure. `
        `	SO. And athletics to improve our hands, but ring-making to improve what belongs to our hands?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And athletics to improve our bodies, but weaving and so on to improve what belongs to the body? `
    d: |
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. So in each case the skill that we use to improve something is different from the one we use to improve what belongs to it. `
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. So it's not true that when you improve what belongs to you, you're also improving yourself. `
        `	AL. Not at all. `
        `	SO. Because it looks like we don't use the same skill to improve both ourselves and ours belongings. `
        `	AL. Apparently not. `
        `	SO. OK then, what kind of skill would we use to improve ourselves?`
        `	AL. I can't tell you. `
    e: |
        `	SO. Well, are we agreed on this much: it's not the same skill that we would use to make anything belonging to us better, but one that makes us better ourselves? `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. If we didn't already know what a shoe was, would we know what skill makes shoes better? `
        `	AL. That would be impossible. `
        `	SO. Or what skill makes rings better, if we didn't know what a ring was?`
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. OK then. If we don't know what we ourselves are, could we ever know what skill makes a person better?`
        `	AL. That would be impossible. `
[129]:
    a: |
        `	SO. Is "knowing thyself" actually easy, then? Was it some average Joe who inscribed that on the temple at Delphi? Or is it something difficult, and not for everyone?`
        `	AL. I've often thought that anyone can do it, Socrates--and often that it's extremely difficult. `
        `	SO. Well, Alcibiades, whether it's easy or not, this is the state that we're in: if we know ourselves we may, perhaps, come to know how to improve ourselves, but if we don't know ourselves, then we never can. `
        `	AL. That's true. `
    b: |
        `	SO. All right then, how can we go about discovering what the self is in itself? Because that way, perhaps, we may find out what we ourselves are-�which is surely impossible as long as we don't know this. `
        `	AL. Correct. `
        `	SO. Hold on, by Zeus! Who are you having this conversation with? With me, right? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And I'm conversing with you? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So Socrates is doing the talking. `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. And Alcibiades is doing the listening? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And isn't Socrates using words to talk? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
    c: |
        `	SO. I assume you'd say that talking and using words are the same thing? `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. But the user is different what he uses, right? `
        `	AL. What do you mean?`
        `	SO. For example, a cobbler presumably uses knives and other tools to cut leather. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Isn't the person using the tools to do the cutting different from the tools he uses to cut with? `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And isn't the lyre-player, in the same way, different from the instruments he uses when he's playing?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    d: |
        `	SO. That's what I meant just now, when I asked whether you think the user is always different from what he uses. `
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. Going back to the cobbler, then, should we say he cuts leather only with his tools, or also with his hands? `
        `	AL. Also with his hands. `
        `	SO. So that's something else he uses?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And does he use his eyes, too, when he's making shoes?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. But we agreed that the user is different from what he uses?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    e: |
        `	SO. So are the cobbler and the lyre-player different from the hands and eyes they use to do their work?`
        `	AL. Apparently. `
        `	SO. In fact, doesn't a person use his whole body?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. But we established that the user is different from what he uses?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So a human being is different from his body. `
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. What is a human being, then?`
        `	AL. I can't say. `
        `	SO. Well you can say this much: it's what uses the body. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Is there anything that does that other than the soul? `
[130]:
    a: |
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. And doesn't the soul govern the body?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And here's another thing I don't think anyone would disagree with. `
        `	AL. What's that? `
        `	SO. That a human being is one of three things. `
        `	AL. What things?`
        `	SO. Soul, body, or a synthesis of the two. `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Well, didn't we agree that the thing governing the body is the human being?`
        `	AL. We did. `
    b: |
        `	SO. And does the body govern itself?`
        `	AL. No way. `
        `	SO. Because we say that it is governed, by something else. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So that can't be what we're looking for. `
        `	AL. It doesn't look like it. `
        `	SO. So does the soul-body synthesis govern the body? Is that what a human being is?`
        `	AL. Certainly--perhaps. `
        `	SO. No, that's the least likely candidate. Because there's no way the synthesis could govern unless both its elements participate in governing. `
        `	AL. Correct. `
    c: |
        `	SO. So neither the body nor this synthesis is what a human being is. What's left, I think, is that either it's nothing at all, or else, if it is something, that turns out to be nothing other than the soul. `
        `	AL. I completely agree. `
        `	SO. Do you need any clearer demonstration, then, that the soul is the human being? `
        `	AL. No, by Zeus. I think this is sufficient. `
        `	SO. It's not very precise, but it's good enough for now. `
    d: |
        `We'll know about it more precisely when we discover something we skipped earlier because it required so much investigation. `
        `	AL. What was that?`
        `	SO. What we said just now: that first we have to examine the self in itself. Instead, we've been examining each self individually. But that may perhaps be adequate. After all, I don't suppose we'd call any aspect of ourselves more authoritative than the soul?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Is this a good way to think about it, then: when you and I are talking to each other, one soul is using words to address another soul?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
    e: |
        `	SO. So this is what we were actually saying just now: Socrates is conversing with you, Alcibiades, using words that are apparently addressed not to your face but to Alcibiades himself, that is, to your soul. `
        `	AL. That's what I think. `
        `	SO. So the person who commanded us to "Know Thyself" is really telling us to get to know our souls? `
[131]:
    a: |
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. So someone whose knowledge comes from skills dealing with the body knows what belongs to him, but doesn't know himself?`
        `	AL. Right. `
        `	SO. So no doctor knows himself, to the extent that he's a doctor, and no trainer, to the extent that he's a trainer?`
        `	AL. It doesn't look like it. `
        `	SO. So farmers and other craftsmen are a long way from knowing themselves. It looks like their skills don't even give them knowledge of what belongs to them, only of things that are even more distant. `
    b: |
        `Because they only know about what belongs to the body, which is used to care for it. `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. So if knowing oneself is self-discipline, then not one of these people has gained self-discipline as a result of his skill. `
        `	AL. I don't think so, no. `
        `	SO. That's presumably why these skills are thought of as lower-class, not things to be learned by a man of the elite. `
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. Again, someone who cares for his body isn't caring for himself, only for something that belongs to him?`
        `	AL. Probably. `
    c: |
        `	SO. But someone who cares for money is caring not for himself or for what belongs to him, but for something even more distant?`
        `	AL. I think so, yes. `
        `	SO. So the money-maker is no longer really operating in his own sphere?`
        `	AL. Correct. `
        `	SO. So if someone falls in love with Alcibiades' body, he's not really in love with Alcibiades, only with something that belongs to Alcibiades?`
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. But the person who's in love with your soul is in love with you. `
        `	AL. Based on the argument, it looks like that must be the case. `
        `	SO. If someone's in love with your body, won't he vanish as soon as the flower of beauty starts to fade?`
        `	AL. Obviously. `
    d: |
        `	SO. But someone who's in love with your soul won't give up, as long as you continue to improve?`
        `	AL. I guess so. `
        `	SO. That's me! I'm the lover who won't give up on you, but will stay put when your body's starting to decline, after everyone else has left. `
        `	AL. And a good thing too, Socrates. Don't ever leave!`
        `	SO. Then do your best to make yourself look as fine as possible!`
        `	AL. I certainly will. `
    e: |
        `	SO. This is the situation, then. It looks like there is not, and has never been, more than one man--a beloved one!--who's in love with Alcibiades, son of Kleinias. That man is Socrates, son of Sophroniskos and Phainarete. `
        `	AL. Right. `
        `	SO. When I approached you earlier, didn't you say I'd just beaten you to it? You'd been meaning to approach me first, because you wanted to find out whyI was the only one who hadn't given up on you? `
        `	AL. Yes, that's true. `
        `	SO. Well this is the reason: I was the only one in love with you. The rest were only in love with things belonging to you. Those things are passing their prime, but you are just coming into flower. `
[132]:
    a: |
        `And now I'm never going to leave you, as long as the Athenian public doesn't corrupt you by making you look shameful. This is my greatest fear--that you'll be corrupted by falling in love with the public. That's already happened to a lot of good Athenians. The offspring of"great-hearted Erechtheus"--I mean the Athenian public--has a very charming face. But you need to observe it as a whole, unclothed. So I suggest you take this precaution. `
        `	AL. What precaution? `
    b: |
        `	SO. Strip and get into training first yourself, my carefree friend. Go into public life only after you've learned the things that must be learned ahead of time, and not before. That way you'll have an antidote, to stop anything terrible from happening to you. `
        `	AL. I think you're right, Socrates. But please try and explain how we can improve ourselves. `
        `	SO. We've already made this much progress: we've reached agreement-�pretty much--about what we are. We were afraid that if we got that wrong we'd be improving something else, without realizing it, instead of ourselves. `
        `	AL. That's true. `
    c: |
        `	SO. Next we agreed that we should improve our souls--that this should be our focus. `
        `	AL. Clearly. `
        `	SO. And we should give other people the job of improving our bodies and property. `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Then how can we get the clearest knowledge of these things? It looks like if we know that, we'll also know ourselves. But wait! By the gods, are we misunderstanding the eloquent Delphic inscription that we talked about just now? `
        `	AL. Why do you say that, Socrates? What are you thinking? `
    d: |
        `	SO. I'll tell you what I suspect the inscription is saying, and advising us to do. There's probably only one good model for this, and that is sight. `
        `	AL. What do you mean?`
        `	SO. You think about it too. Suppose the inscription addressed our eyes, as if they were human beings, and said "See Yourself." What advice would we take it to be giving? That they should look into something in which they're going to see themselves, right?`
        `	AL. Yes, clearly. `
    e: |
        `	SO. Is there anything we can think of that we can look into if we want to see both our eyes and ourselves at the same time?`
        `	AL. Clearly you mean mirrors, Socrates, and things like that. `
        `	SO. Correct! And isn't there also something of that kind in the same eye that's doing the seeing?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
[133]:
    a: |
        `	SO. Have you ever noticed that when you look into someone else's eye your own face appears there, as if in a mirror? We call that the pupil--a miniature likeness of the person who's looking. `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. So by observing another eye, and looking into the best part of it--the part it sees with--an eye can see itself? `
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. But it won't see itself if it looks at any other part of a human being, or at anything else, unless it's something that actually resembles the eye. `
    b: |
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. So if an eye's going to see itself, it must use itself to look into another eye, specifically at the region where an eye's goodness is located. And that, presumably, is sight? `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Along the same lines, then, my dear Alcibiades, if the soul is going to know itself, it must use itself to look into a soul, and above all at the region where a soul's goodness--i.e. wisdom--is located, or at something else that actually resembles the soul. `
        `	AL. I think so, Socrates. `
    c: |
        `	SO. Is there any aspect of the soul that we could call more godlike than its concern with knowledge and wisdom? `
        `	AL. No. `
        `	SO. So this aspect of the soul is like a god, and anyone who looks at it and knows what is godlike as a whole--both divinity and wisdom--will also know himself most fully?`
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. But we agreed that self-knowledge is the same as self-discipline?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. If we don't know ourselves, then, and aren't self-disciplined, can we ever know what belongs to us, whether it's good or bad?`
        `	AL. That would be impossible, Socrates. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Perhaps that's because, in your view, it would be impossible for anyone who doesn't know Alcibiades to know that what belongs to Alcibiades is his. `
        `	AL. Completely impossible, by Zeus!`
        `	SO. So if we don't know ourselves, we can't know that what belongs to us is ours, either? `
        `	AL. How could we? `
        `	SO. But if we don't even know what's ours, then we also can't know what belongs to the things that are ours?`
        `	AL. Apparently not. `
        `	SO. So we weren't entirely correct when we agreed just now that some people know themselves without knowing what is theirs, and others know what belongs to the things that are theirs. It looks like just one person, and one skill, covers all these things: `
    e: |
        `oneself, what is ours, and what belongs to the things that are ours. `
        `	AL. Probably. `
        `	SO. And, on the same principle, presumably someone who doesn't know what's his wouldn't know what belongs to other people?`
        `	AL. Of course not. `
        `	SO. And if he doesn't know what belongs to other people, he won't know what belongs to cities either?`
        `	AL. He couldn't. `
        `	SO. So a man like that can't become expert at politics?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
        `	SO. Or at managing a household?`
        `	AL. Certainly not. `
[134]:
    a: |
        `	SO. And he won't know what he's doing, either?`
        `	AL. No, he won't. `
        `	SO. And won't anyone who doesn't know what he's doing make mistakes?`
        `	AL. Absolutely. `
        `	SO. And because he makes mistakes, he'll behave badly in both private and public life, won't he?`
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. And if he behaves badly won't he be miserable?`
        `	AL. Very much so. `
        `	SO. What about the people he has dealings with?`
        `	AL. Them too. `
        `	SO. So it's not possible for anyone to thrive without being self-disciplined and good. `
    b: |
        `	AL. No, it's not possible. `
        `	SO. So bad people are miserable. `
        `	AL. Very much so. `
        `	SO. So it's not by getting rich that a person escapes misery, but by becoming self-disciplined. `
        `	AL. It looks like it. `
        `	SO. So, Alcibiades, cities don't need walls, or triremes, or dockyards if they're going to thrive, or numbers or size--unless they have goodness. `
        `	AL. They certainly don't. `
    c: |
        `	SO. So if you're really going to conduct the city's business in a correct and admirable way, you must provide the citizens with goodness. `
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. Can anyone provide something that he doesn't have?`
        `	AL. How could he?`
        `	SO. So you must first acquire goodness yourself, and so must anyone else who's going to govern and improve not just himself and his private life but the city and public life. `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. So what you need to obtain, for yourself and the city, is not the power to do whatever you want through governing, but justice and self-discipline. `
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
    d: |
        `	SO. Because if you and the city act with justice and self-discipline, you'll both be doing what pleases the gods. `
        `	AL. I guess so. `
        `	SO. And as we said earlier, you'll be acting with your eyes fixed on what's radiant and divine. `
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. Very well then, if you focus on that you'll gain vision and knowledge both of yourselves and of what's good for you. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And won't you then behave correctly and well?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
    e: |
        `	SO. Very well then, if you behave like that you have my personal guarantee that you will thrive. `
        `	AL. That's a guarantee I can rely on!`
        `	SO. But if you behave unjustly, focusing on what is dark and godless, you're likely to behave like someone without self-knowledge. `
        `	AL. It looks like it, yes. `
        `	SO. Because, my dear Alcibiades, if someone has the power to do what he wants, in private or public life, but lacks understanding, what's likely to happen? `
[135]:
    a: |
        `For example, suppose a sick man has the power to do whatever he wants but doesn't have a doctor's understanding, so he plays the tyrant and forbids anyone to criticize him. What's going to happen? Isn't his bodily health likely become further corrupted? `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. Or on a ship, if someone had the power to do what he thinks best, but lacked a good helmsman's understanding, can you see what would happen to him and his fellow sailors? `
        `	AL. I certainly can. They would all perish. `
        `	SO. Doesn't the same apply to a city, and all situations involving governing and power? Without goodness, bad behavior will result. `
    b: |
        `	AL. Yes, it has to. `
        `	SO. If you're going to thrive, then, my excellent Alcibiades, you must bring about goodness, not tyranny, in both yourself and the city. `
        `	AL. You're right. `
        `	SO. And until anyone has goodness, it's better for a man--not just for a child--if he doesn't govern, but is governed by someone better than himself. `
        `	AL. Apparently so. `
        `	SO. And isn't what's better also more admirable?`
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. And what's more admirable is more appropriate? `
    c: |
        `	AL. Of course. `
        `	SO. So it's appropriate for a bad person to be enslaved, because it's better that way. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. So badness is appropriate to slaves. `
        `	AL. Apparently. `
        `	SO. And goodness is appropriate to free men. `
        `	AL. Yes. `
        `	SO. Shouldn't we retreat, my comrade, from anything that's appropriate to slaves? `
        `	AL. Absolutely, Socrates. `
        `	SO. And are you aware of the state you're in now? Is it appropriate to a free man, or not?`
        `	AL. I think I'm very well aware of it. `
        `	SO. Then do you know how to escape your current predicament? (I won't embarrass a fine-looking man like you by naming it.) `
    d: |
        `	AL. I do. `
        `	SO. How?`
        `	AL. I can do it if you want me to, Socrates. `
        `	SO. Don't say that, Alcibiades. `
        `	AL. What should I say, then?`
        `	SO. That you can do it if a god wills it. `
        `	AL. That's what I'm saying, then. But I'll add this: the two of us will probably be switching roles, Socrates, with me taking your place and you mine. There's no way I won't be following you around, and you won't have me as your follower, from today onward. `

        `	SO. So my passion for you will be like a stork, my noble friend: after hatching a winged passion within you, it will in turn be cared for by its offspring. `
        `	AL. It certainly will! I'm going to improve my understanding of justice, starting right now. `
        `	SO. I certainly want you to achieve that goal, but I'm very much afraid that you may not. It's not that I lack confidence in your natural gifts, but I can see how strong the city is. In the end, it may defeat both me and you. `
