        <p>
          The Open Plato Project aims to create a new kind of digital edition of
          ancient Greek philosophical texts, intended for both expert and
          non-expert audiences and produced in collaboration with scholars from
          multiple disciplines. The Project’s mission is to widen the audience
          of people who are able to find joy and meaning in the study of these
          texts. Its core belief is that expanding access to the study of
          philosophical texts is beneficial both to society and to scholarship.
          The first phase of this project will yield an online, open-access, and
          open source edition of Plato’s <em>Alcibiades</em>, including both a
          new translation and multiple layers of commentary.
